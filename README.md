# Approach Taken:

The data pipeline has been implemented using a combination of Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch.
Apache Kafka is used for data ingestion, where clickstream data is consumed from Kafka topics.
The consumed clickstream data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, following a predefined schema.
Periodic data processing is performed using Apache Spark, which retrieves data from PostgreSQL, performs aggregations, and calculates metrics such as click count, unique users, and average time spent.
The processed data is then indexed in Elasticsearch, allowing for efficient searching and analysis.
## Assumptions Made:

### Kafka Setup: 
It is assumed that Apache Kafka is properly set up and configured, including the creation of Kafka topics for clickstream data ingestion.
### Data Schema: 
A specific schema for storing clickstream data in PostgreSQL is assumed, with column families such as click_data, geo_data, and user_agent_data. The column names and types are not explicitly provided, so they can be customized as per the specific requirements.
### Data Processing Logic: 
The exact data processing logic for Apache Spark is not specified, so it can be tailored to the specific business needs. The assumed logic involves grouping data by URL and country and calculating metrics such as click count, unique users, and average time spent.
### Elasticsearch Configuration: 
It is assumed that Elasticsearch is properly installed and configured with the required resources and that the Elasticsearch index is created to store the processed data.
### Integration and Workflow: 
The overall integration and workflow between the different components (Kafka, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Spark) are assumed to be managed and orchestrated appropriately, including managing connections, dependencies, and error handling.

## Key Deliverables:

### Kafka Consumer: 
Code that sets up a Kafka consumer to ingest clickstream data from Kafka topics and passes the data for further processing.
### PostgreSQL Storage: 
Code to store the ingested clickstream data in a PostgreSQL database, adhering to the assumed schema.
### Spark Data Processing: 
Code that utilizes Apache Spark to perform data processing and aggregation on the stored clickstream data, calculating metrics like click count, unique users, and average time spent.
### Elasticsearch Indexing: 
Code to index the processed data into Elasticsearch, enabling efficient data searching and analysis.
